[ESPEECH happy auto] Hello! This is a completely automated video i made using Python.
[TEXTSPEECH auto] In my current workflow, i write a script and it gets processed into a video.
[TEXTSPEECH auto] The script has custom formatting and commands, like ESPEECH, START or END.
[ESPEECH happy_screaming auto] I hope you like it! For the assets i used my own scanned sketches.
[ESPEECH speaking_low auto] But the script isn't perfect. For now, it's just a proof of concept.
[TEXTSPEECH auto] But nevertheless, pretty cool! Goodbye!
